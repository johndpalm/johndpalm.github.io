This is the source for this site: https://johndpalm.com

The drafts are stored in a private repo using Azure Repos.  I have a CI/CD pipeline, using Azure Pipelines, to install and run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) to generate the pages. Then the static site is uploaded to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

The azure-pipeline.yml configuration originated from reading this blog post: [Build your Jekyll site and Deploy it on GitHub Pages with an Azure DevOps pipeline](https://xaviergeerinck.com/deploying-gh-pages-with-azure-pipelines)
