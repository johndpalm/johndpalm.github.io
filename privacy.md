# Privacy Policy

Last updated: {{ site.time | date: "%Y-%m-%d" }}

This Privacy Policy describes how {{ site.title | default: "this site" }} ("we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, and shares information when you visit {{ site.url | default: site.github.url | default: "this website" }} (the "Site"). We aim to be transparent and collect the minimum data necessary to operate a personal, developer-focused website.

## Summary

- This is a static website built with Jekyll and hosted via GitHub Pages.
- We do not sell your data. We collect only what is necessary to operate and improve the Site.
- Any third-party embeds (e.g., LinkedIn) may set their own cookies and collect usage data according to their policies.
- You can contact us at {{ site.email | default: "contact@example.com" }} to exercise your privacy rights.

## Information We Collect

Because this is a static site, we do not directly collect personal information through forms by default. However, the following information may be collected automatically or via third parties when you use the Site:

1. Usage and device data
	- When you visit the Site, standard web server logs may record your IP address, browser type, referring/exit pages, timestamps, and other technical details. When hosted on GitHub Pages, some of this logging may occur on GitHub infrastructure and be subject to GitHub’s policies.

2. Cookies and similar technologies
	- The Site itself does not require cookies for basic functionality. However, third-party embeds (e.g., LinkedIn profile badge) may set cookies and collect usage data. See “Third-Party Services” below.

3. Voluntary communications
	- If you contact us via email (e.g., {{ site.email }}), we will receive your email address and any information you include. We use this information solely to respond to your inquiry.

## Third-Party Services

We use or may use the following third-party services. Their collection and use of information is governed by their own privacy policies:

- GitHub Pages (hosting): https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement
- LinkedIn (profile badge/embed): https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy

If we add analytics (e.g., Google Analytics, Microsoft Clarity) or other integrations in the future, we will update this policy and, where required, present a cookie notice and/or obtain consent.

## How We Use Information

We use usage information to:
- Operate, maintain, and secure the Site
- Understand aggregate traffic patterns (e.g., which pages are most visited)
- Diagnose issues and improve performance

We do not use your data for advertising or profiling.

## Legal Bases (EEA/UK Visitors)

Where the GDPR/UK GDPR applies, we rely on the following legal bases, as applicable:
- Legitimate interests to operate and secure the Site and understand its usage
- Consent for any non-essential cookies/analytics (if implemented in the future)

## Your Rights

Depending on your location, you may have rights such as:
- Access, correct, or delete your personal information
- Object to or restrict certain processing
- Withdraw consent where processing relies on consent
- Lodge a complaint with your local data protection authority

To exercise your rights, contact us at {{ site.email | default: "contact@example.com" }}.

## Data Retention

We retain only the minimum information necessary for the purposes outlined above and for as long as needed to operate the Site, resolve disputes, or comply with legal obligations. Server logs and third-party analytics (if enabled) are retained according to the hosting provider’s or service’s retention schedules.

## Security

We take reasonable measures to protect information transmitted to and from the Site. However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure. Please use caution when sharing information over the internet.

## International Transfers

Because the Site may be hosted and accessed globally, information may be processed in countries other than your own. Where applicable, we rely on appropriate safeguards consistent with data protection laws.

## Children’s Privacy

The Site is not directed to children under 13 (or the age required by local law). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a child has provided us information, please contact us to request deletion.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The “Last updated” date at the top indicates when this Policy was last revised. Your continued use of the Site after any changes means you accept the updated Policy.
